Why does it use Python3 as the game script when it's clearly called Era.js?



Why use Javascript + Python3? Instead of unifying?



What is the design philosophy of the engine?



Who is the audience for the engine? What has the engine been designed for them?

First of all, I'm sorry to say that the first audience for the engine was me, because I created the game engine project mainly to develop a game I liked. This means that the engine's functionality, scale, technology stack, usage, presentation, and even aesthetic taste are limited to some extent. But it also means that, as an audience, the engine has done separate optimizations for different characters. And if you happen to have similar needs for writing games and game engines as I do, I highly recommend that you take a look at all aspects of the engine:

-   for game developers
-   for players
-   for secondary game developers

- for game engine code contributors

What is the current progress of the engine?



What is the future of the engine (macroscopically)?



Is it recommended to use the engine now?



Is it recommended to contribute code to the engine now?



Will you abandon the pit?
